# Progressive Neural Networks for Multitask Reinforcement Learning
This project was undertaken as a part of the course [CS 747: Foundations of Intelligent & Learning Agents](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/teaching/old/cs747-a2018/index.html).

We implemented the framework of this paper [Progressive Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04671.pdf) and tried reproducing results on two of the Atari games, Pong and Breakout.

Feel free to check out the [report](report.pdf) for more details.
